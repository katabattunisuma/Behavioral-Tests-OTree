<p style="text-align: center">In this game you will make ten decisions. Please make your choices carefully. The Decision Screen shows a choice between Option A
and Option B. You will make one choice and record it in the choice column. Then you will move to the next Decision Screen. Even
though you will make ten decisions, if this game is selected for payment only one decision will affect your earnings. <br><br>
One of the decisions you make will be selected randomly for your payment. Since you do not know in advance which decision will be
selected, your best approach is to make each decision as if it is the one that will be selected for payment. Each decision has an equal
chance of being selected.<br><br>
In this game, 1 token is equal to $3. Once the game is over, we will ask one of you to volunteer to draw a chip from a bag. The bag
contains 10 chips numbered 1 through 10, one for each decision in this game. After pulling the chip, your payment will be determined
based on your decision and a roll of a dice. This will be explained in the following screens.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.</p><br>
