    As subjects are entering lab: "Please sit at the computer station corresponding to the number on your disk. Thank you for coming here today. Before we begin the study, we ask that you turn off and refrain from using your cell phones during the experiment. <br>The study you will take part in is conducted to examine economic decision taking abilities and attitudes
<br>
I will be reading from a script today. This way. I can assure that I say exactly the same things in all sessions. Please feel free to stop me and ask your questions at any time. People usually ask a lot of questions so don't hold back! Please do not talk to each other or look at each other's screens. Please note there are no right or wrong answers. We are simply interested in what you think and what you would do. Also, note that your answers will be kept strictly confidential and will never be shared with anyone outside the research team. You will all be working on five separate tasks. Please wait once each task is over, we will escort you back here for mini break for 3-4 minutes and set the 2nd/3rd/4th 5th/6h games. First, we will calibrate the eye-tracking equipment to your eye-movements. Once everyone is calibrated, the study will begin. Please raise your hand if you have a question at any point during the experiment and we will come to you."
