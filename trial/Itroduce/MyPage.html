<p style="text-align: center;"> Welcome and thank you for participating in our study. You will receive $15.00 for participation which will be yours to keep. Today you will play 6 games. One of the games will be randomly picked at the end of the session for payoffs. Through the game, you will have the opportunity to make more earnings based on your performance, your decisions, and luck. So, please pay attention to the instructions. Your incentives will be calculated in experimental tokens, which will be equated at the end of the session. Each game is worth a total of $10.00. Since you do not know in advance which game and round will be selected, your best approach is to attempt for complete accuracy as if it is the one that will be selected for payment. Your total earnings will be calculated and paid to you at the end

of the session. Please do not talk to other participants.
<br>
    Please wait after each game, and one of our team members will escort you for your break. <br>Please raise your hands if you have any questions, otherwise click Next.</p> <br><br>
