<p style="text-align: center;">For the first phase of the study, you are given the following test:<br>

Your instructions are to sequentially subtract a random 2-digit number from the given number and type the answers one by one followed by the Return Key. You are given 8 seconds for each operation, and you will continue to perform this math for a maximum of 10 minutes. Each correct answer will give you 1 token worth 50 cents, but every time you make an error in the calculation, an error window appears, and you lose all your earnings, and you will start from the beginning.

<br>A sample screen is given for better understanding.<br>
