<p style="text-align: center;">In this first game, you will be given a small paragraph of random letters. Your task is to count the number of times a single letter

occurs in the paragraph. The letter will be provided to you in the next screen and will change with every new paragraph. Type only the number (frequency) in the box at the bottom of the paragraph on the screen. The arrows on the screen can help you move forward to the next question. You are given a total of 10 similar rounds in separate pages, and the time allotted is 4 minutes. If this task is chosen for payoff, you will receive 1 experimental token, each worth $1.00 for each correct answer. Each trial has an

equal chance of being selected.<br>

A sample paragraph is given to you in the next screen.<br>
