<p style="text-align: center;">In this game, you will be given a small paragraph of random letters. Your task is to count the number of times a single letter

   occurs in the paragraph. The letter will be provided to you in the next screen and will change with every new paragraph. Type only the number (frequency) in the box at the bottom of the paragraph on the screen. You are given a total of 12 similar rounds in separate pages, and the <i><b>time allotted is 5 minutes for all the rounds combined</b></i>. If this task is chosen for payoff, you will receive 1 experimental token for each correct answer, each worth $1.00 for each correct answer. Each trial has an

equal chance of being selected.<br>

A sample paragraph is given to you in the next screen.<br>
